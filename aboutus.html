    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Fxdcord is a business made up of young and creative individuals passionate about 
        crafting handmade fashion accessories designed for a youthful audience. At just twenty
         (20) years old, I began my entrepreneurial journey with the support of friends and
          family. Within a few months, my business started to flourish and expand, particularly
           in the online space. </p>
        <p>The brand's products radiate a beach vibe, incorporating real seashells into our
             designs. The bracelets, anklets, and necklaces we create have become trendy and
              highly sought after among young people today.</p>

<!-- Began Section -->
<section class="began">
    <h1>Began</h1>
    <p>The business began on June 9, 2022, in Paracale, Camarines Norte, with the hope of 
        gaining recognition not only within the province but throughout the Philippines. 
        We now have multiple resellers and business partners using the same brand name across the country.</p>
        <p>As young entrepreneurs in the industry, we have faced several challenges, one of 
            which is establishing a loyal customer base. During our initial months, it was 
            difficult to attract and retain customers since we were selling our products 
            primarily on the streets of Paracale and Jose Panganiban in Camarines Norte. 
            This challenge was compounded by the fact that the market is already saturated with 
            established brands and that both Paracale and Jose Panganiban are traditionally known 
            for producing fine jewelry rather than our type of fashion accessories.</p>
        <p>To overcome this, we focused our efforts on marketing our products online to reach a wider and younger audience.</p>

<!-- We Found Section -->
<section class="we-found">
    <h1>We Found</h1>
    <p>Last year, while my brother and I were selling our handmade products on the streets of Paracale, 
        I was approached by the Negosyo Center Business Counselor of the municipality. She encouraged 
        me to register my business name and offered to invite me to join a local trade fair at SM City Daet. 
        Since then, I have participated in numerous local trade fairs in the province, including regional trade fairs.</p>
        <p>In May, we took part in the Orgullo Kan Bikol (OKB) event at Shangri-La Plaza in Mandaluyong City. 
            The LGU Paracale supported us, and we participated again this October in the National Arts and Crafts 
            Fair at SM Megamall in Mandaluyong. With the assistance of the NCBC, who helped subsidize my registration 
            and fare worth Php 3,500.00, we were able to attend.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I participated in two Product Development activities organized by the DTI. This year, 
            I will join the Kapatid Mentor ME program to further expand my knowledge in managing my business through mentoring.</p>

    <h1>Own</h1>
    <p>FxdCord is owned and created by a young man named April Atanacio Jr., who lives in Paracale, 
        Camarines Norte. Growing up in a broken family, he had little but a dream to become a fine artist. 
        Throughout his teenage years, he developed a passion for fixed-gear cycling, mural painting, and 
        creating various forms of art such as portraits, landscapes, charcoal drawings, and visual arts. 
        Anything related to art and crafts captured his interest. From a young age, his mother supported 
        and nurtured his passion for art.</p>
        <p>At the age of 19, April made a promise to himself that when he turned 20, he would no longer be 
            a teenager. He believed that from that point on, he would no longer rely on others for support. 
            His philosophy was simple: whatever you do with your heart, money will follow.</p>
        <p>Two months before his 20th birthday in May, while he was in Manila, April began to form the idea 
            for his business. He eventually decided to leave school to focus on this vision. On June 9, 2022, 
            FxdCord officially came to life, blending his love for bikes and art into accessories that would 
            leave a lasting impact across generations. By July 9, 2022, his 20th birthday, FxdCord had turned 
            from an idea into a reality. This is the story of how FxdCord was created.</p>
