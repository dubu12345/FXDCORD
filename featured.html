        <h2>21-year-old turns P140 into house, land ownership</h2>
        <p><strong>By GMA Regional TV News<br>Published July 07, 2024 8:38 PM</strong></p>
        <p>
            A 21-year-old man from Barangay Maybato, Paracale, Camarines Norte, has proven that hard work and perseverance lead to success, 
            turning a P140 investment in bracelet-making into a thriving business that has allowed him to buy his own house and land.
        </p>
        <p>
            April Atanacio’s journey began before the COVID-19 pandemic, with a modest P140 investment. He initially decorated an old necklace and, 
            pleased with the result, bought materials to start making bracelets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Atanacio began selling his creations outside the Paracale church and eventually expanded to various locations in Bicol. He said the 
            Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) played a significant role in guiding his entrepreneurial efforts.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "Masaya po... talagang tinatangkilik naman siya specially dito at pag lumilipat ako outside Camarines Norte. 
            Talagang na-appreciate nila kasi sila na mismo nag-aaya sakin na pumunta sa place nila," Atanacio said.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Despite the challenges, Atanacio's determination paid off, allowing him to purchase a house and land for her family. This success also enabled 
            him to bring his mother, Elen Mapusao, an overseas Filipino worker, back home.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mapusao was not supportive of Atanacio's business initially. She said she preferred that her son prioritize his studies.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "Parati ko po sinasabi sa kanya na mas priority dapat niya yung pag-aaral niya, kasi yung business pagkatapos niyang mag-aral 
            nandiyan lang yan na pwede ulit siya mag-umpisa. Ang gusto ko kasi sa kanya makatapos siya," Mapusao said.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Now, the initial P140 investment yields thousands of pesos in monthly earnings, and Atanacio employs workers from various parts of the region.
        </p>
        <p>
            True to his promise to his mother, Atanacio plans to return to school this 2024 to complete senior high school and eventually finish college.
        </p>
